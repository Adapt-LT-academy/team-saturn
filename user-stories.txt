TIPS ON WRITING USER STORIES:

As a <user role/customer>
I want to <goal to be accomplished>
so that I can <reason of the goal>.

“Given some precondition when I do some action then I expect the result”.

Hence, the User story defines the requirement for any functionality or feature while the Acceptance Criteria defines the ‘Definition of done’ for the user story or the requirement.
